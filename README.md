# Automated Toll Booth Project

This repository contains the code and resources for an Automated Toll Booth system. The system is designed to automate the toll collection process and vehicle identification using RFID and number plate recognition (NPR) technology.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- **Backend**: Contains the backend scripts and notebooks for data processing, RFID handling, and number plate recognition.
- **Frontend**: Includes the frontend code for user interfaces, data visualization, and system control.
- **Data**: Stores the datasets, CSV files, and images used for training and testing the system.

## Components

### Backend

The backend component consists of the following scripts and notebooks:

- **main.py**: Handles RFID data entry, transaction logging, and data retrieval for toll booth operations.
- **NPR.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for number plate recognition using computer vision and OCR techniques.
- **Data Files**: CSV files containing RFID data, customer details, and vehicle information.

### Frontend

The frontend component includes the following elements:

- **User Interface**: Provides a user interface for toll booth operators and system administrators to monitor and control the toll collection process.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays visualizations and reports related to toll collection, traffic flow, and system performance.

## Setup and Usage

To set up and use the Automated Toll Booth system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies and libraries using the provided requirements.txt file.
3. Run the backend scripts and notebooks to initialize the system and process the data.
4. Launch the frontend user interface to interact with the system and monitor toll booth operations.
